My first program using OpenGL with C++. This a simple project that creates a fireworks show in a small window. 
Press Q to add more fireworks to the screen.

Project Controls:
  WASD - Moves the camera.
  Mouse - Move the mouse to change the direction that the camera faces.
  Q - Launches a new firework.
